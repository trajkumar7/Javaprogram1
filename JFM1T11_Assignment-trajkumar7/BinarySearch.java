/* JFM1T11_Assignment2:

   Write a program to execute the search of a number in a sorted array following the below logic: 
   If the target element is greater than middle element then you go to the middle of the right of the remaining numbers 
   or otherwise towards middle of the left of the remaining numbers. 
   Continue until the number is either found or not found.
   Prompt the user input from the terminal.
   
   Sample Input: 2,5,10,12,15,20,25,31,40
   Enter number to search x= 20

   Expected Output: Position of element is : 6
   
   Enter number to search x= 26
   Expected Output: Sorry,Key doesn't exist in the array

//if mid is equal to key than it stops and return mid

//if mid element is greater than key then it calculates end and mid

//checking beg is greater than end, then mid = 0
